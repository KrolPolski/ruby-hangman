# Mastermind

This is a command line version of Hangman, a popular word guessing game. I completed this as part of The Odin Project's [Ruby curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-hangman).

### Running instructions
To be able to run it, you'll need to have ruby installed. It also requires the colorize gem, as defined in the gem file. If you have bundler set up, you can just run:
```
bundle install
ruby hangman.rb
```
Or you can just do:
```
gem install colorize
```
Once colorize has been installed, all you have to do is run:

```
ruby mastermind.rb
```
